# Anchor Script

Enhance your gameplay realism by allowing boats and seaplanes to anchor and stay stationary on water surfaces.  
This script includes flexible configuration options to tailor restrictions and behavior to your server’s needs. Vehicle-specific anchor states are synced across all players and tracked using license plates.  
Adding supported vehicles is quick and easy through the `config.lua` file—no coding required.

#  Note:
When adding new vehicles, it is strongly recommended to enable debug mode `Config.Debug = true` to ensure correct setup and identification.
